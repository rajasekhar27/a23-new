            <p className="mb-[14px]">The 1968 ruling of the Honourable Supreme Court of India states that Rummy is a skill-based cards game where success depends on the 'mere skill' of the person, which cannot be regarded as 'gambling'. However, the Indian states, including Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Sikkim,  Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, are exempted from this law.

            <p className="mb-[14px]">It is quite easy to learn <Link href="rummy/how-to-play-rummy.html" target="new">how to play rummy</Link> online. Indian rummy can be played either on two player tables or six player tables with a single deck or with two decks of cards, respectively. Players sit around a table, picking and discarding cards when their turn comes. Cards can be picked from either a closed deck or an open deck. However, the discarded cards must be placed in the open deck. </p>
            <p className="mb-[14px]">When playing rummy online, your objective is to defeat all other players at the table by making sequences and sets of cards first. You can play the free games on A23 to get a hang of it.</p>
            <p className="mb-[14px]">The objective of rummy is to arrange the 13 cards you've been dealt into sets and sequences. Each game requires you to make at least 2 -  one of which must be without a Joker (pure sequence), while the other one can use the Joker. The game commences with a toss that decides which player will make the first move. Remember: focus on making a pure sequence first, then the second sequence, followed by other sequences or sets.</p>

            <p className="mb-[14px]">Rummy is a skill-based card game where 2-6 players can take part in a game of Rummy. There are 13 cards per player, and each deck contains 2 Jokers (wild/cut and printed/paper).</p>
            <p className="mb-[14px]">Additionally, there are 2 stacks from which each player can select cards, thereby drawing a card.</p>
            <p className="mb-[14px]">Once a player draws a card, he has to get rid of one card - this is called discarding.</p>
            <p className="mb-[14px]">Sorting of cards is done at the beginning of the game. This is done to arrange your cards to help you form your sets and sequences reducing the probability of mixing the cards. Once the cards are displayed, you can hit the Sort button and start playing.</p>
            <p className="mb-[14px]">When a player decides to leave the game table at the start or middle of the rummy game, it is a drop. The act is to withdraw from the game as a personal choice. The first drop=20 points; middle drop= 40 points and last drop and maximum point loss is 80 points.</p>
            <p className="mb-[14px]">In case of Pool rummy, if a player drops in 101 pool, the score is 20. In case it is 201 Pool Rummy, the drop score is 25. In a game where Best of 2/3 is played, a drop is not allowed.</p>
            <p className="mb-[14px]">A wild joker can be any card at random from the closed deck. A wild card joker can replace any card to form an impure sequence.</p>
            <p className="mb-[14px]">In Rummy, one needs to meld their cards into valid sequences and sets. A player must form at least 2 sequences (one pure), and the rest of the cards must be arranged in sequences and/or sets.</p>
            <h3 className="mb-[7px] text-[1.25rem] font-bold">Sequences and sets:</h3>
            <ul className="pl-3 list-disc marker:text-[#eabf69] mb-[14px]">
                <li><b>Pure sequence -</b> A group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit</li>
                <li><b>Impure sequence -</b> A sequence where one or more cards have been replaced by a joker(s)</li>
                <li><b>Set -</b> Three or more cards of the same rank but different suits</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 className="mb-[7px] text-[1.25rem] font-bold">Points Rummy: </h4>
            <p className="mb-[14px]">Of all the variants, this variant moves the fastest. <Link href="rummy/points-rummy.html" target="new">Points Rummy</Link> brings together the thrill of sped and the skill required to play rummy. Each game lasts for a single deal. This means, players get to play more games in a shorter period! Shorter games require a higher level of skill and keep the players on the edge of their seats!</p>
            <h4 className="mb-[7px] text-[1.25rem] font-bold">Pool Rummy: </h4>
            <p className="mb-[14px]">A spin-off of the traditional 13-card Indian rummy, players participating in Pool Rummy are required to pay an entry fee which goes towards the prize pool. When someone wins a deal, they are awarded zero points and the rest accumulated points are added to their score. Once a player's score reaches the maximum limit (101 points or 201 points), they are eliminated from the game. </p>
            <p className="mb-[14px]">Also referred to as syndicate, in this rummy format the player who scores the least is declared the winner. We have three pool formats on A23 site, '101 pool', '201 pool' and 'Best of Three'.</p>

            <p className="mb-[14px]">When it comes to playing Rummy online, it is always handy for a player to know certain ins and outs of the game which can help them gain an advantage over their opponents.</p>
            <ul className="pl-3 list-disc marker:text-[#eabf69] mb-[14px]">
                    <li>Form the pure sequence at the very beginning of the game.</li>
                    <li>Discard cards with high points like Ace, Jack, Queen and King and replace these cards with Joker or Wild Cards to reduce points pileup.</li>
                    <li>Avoid the discard pile. It gives away the hand you're trying to form.</li>
                    <li>Look out for smart cards. For example, a 7 from any suit can work with 5 and 6 of the same suit as well as 8 and 9 of the same suit.</li>
                    <li>Use jokers to replace high value cards. Joker and wildcards cannot be used to form pure sequences.</li>
                    <li>An invalid declaration can turn even a winning game into a complete loss. Make sure your declaration is valid before you meld.</li>
                    <li>Don't give away jokers: You must never give away jokers, especially if you already have a pure sequence. It is because the joker can help you finish another sequence. If there are 2 sequences already, you may use the joker to create sets or runs comprising high-value cards.</li>
                    <li>Keep an eye on the opponents: It is also essential to keep track of the cards that other players choose and discard in different rummy card games. Doing so will help you to block some of the cards that can help them to create melds.</li>
                    <li>Bluffing: Play to trick the opponents. Get rid of cards of lower value at first to create an impression that you have good cards and the opponent might make a wrong move.</li>
