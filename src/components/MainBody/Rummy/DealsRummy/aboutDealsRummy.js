                <h1>Deals Rummy</h1>
                <div className="clear-both"></div>
                <p>When it comes to online card games, <b>Deals Rummy</b> has found quite a bit of popularity in India. In this version, two to six players can <b>play rummy online</b>, although it can be played with as many as eight players. The objective of the game is to be the first player to dispose of all the cards in their hand by forming sets and sequences, as per the Deals Rummy rules.</p>

                <p><b>Deals Rummy</b> is an <Link href="https://www.a23.com/rummy.html" target="_blank"><b>Indian rummy</b></Link> format played between two players. 2/3 deals are played, in which the player with the lowest point count is declared the winner in the end.</p>

                <p>Like all <b>Rummy games</b>, each player is dealt a certain number of cards at the beginning of the game, and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the deck. The card present at the top of the deck is flipped over and then placed on the side, thereby creating the discard pile.</p>

                <p>The top card of the stock pile is then turned over and placed next to it to form the discard pile.</p>

                <p>In Deals Rummy, a card is drawn by the player to the dealer's left from either pile. Players can then meld possible sets/sequences and place them on the table.</p>

                <p>As stated in the <b>Deals Rummy rules</b>, a player can also choose to add cards to existing sets or sequences that have already been melded by other players.</p>

                <p>Once a player melds their cards when they <b>play Rummy online</b>, they must end their turn by discarding one card from their hand and placing it face up on the top of the discard pile. The other player then draws a card from either pile in order to set and sequence them, and the game continues.</p>

                <div className="clear-both"></div>
                
                <h2>Sets and Sequence in Deals Rummy</h2>
                
                <div className="clear-both"></div>

                <p>In <b>Deals Rummy</b>, a set comprises 3-4 cards that have the same value, like three Queens or four sevens. However, a sequence is different - it can be 3-4 consecutive cards from the same suit, like five to seven diamonds. A player can refer to the <b>Deals Rummy rules</b> to learn more.</p>

                <p>The game continues until one player has disposed of all the cards in their hand by melding them. That player then wins the game. If the stock pile runs out of cards before any player has won, the game is considered a draw, and no points are awarded.</p>

                <p>Half count in the case of a deal show is not available in Best of X <b>Rummy Games</b>.</p>

                <p>In Deals Rummy, players are not allowed to drop out or take a middle drop. However, when they don't take any action in the given time, then the timer will drop with a full count score and shown as a drop/middle drop in the result window.</p>

                <p>In <b>Deals Rummy</b>, points are dependent on the cards that players have by the end. Face cards and Aces hold the highest point value, while lower cards like threes hold the least value. The winner is the player with the fewest points.</p>

                <p>Deals Rummy has several versions that can be played, the traditional one and even some that include wild cards/jokers. In some variations, jokers can be used as a replacement for any card in sets/sequences. The <b>Deals Rummy rules</b> vary as per the version.</p>

                <p>In India, Deals Rummy is quite popular among players of all age groups. It is a format of <b>Indian Rummy</b> that is quite simple to learn - however, skill and strategy are key requirements of the game. While individuals can play the game for cash, it can also be enjoyed just for fun with close ones. <b>Play Rummy online</b> on A23 and experience the best of the game on the best <b>Deals</b> <Link href="https://www.a23.com/rummy/download-rummy.html" target="_blank"><b>Rummy App</b></Link>.
