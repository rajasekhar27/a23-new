                                If you are new to Rummy online, we suggest that you <b>learn Rummy</b> before venturing into serious <Link href="https://www.a23.com/rummy.html">Rummy games</Link>. <b>Learn rummy online</b> on the A23 Rummy app, which allows new gamers to try their hands and develop their Online Rummy skills. And in order to achieve that, it is important to complete the Rummy tutorials for various types of the game, including <b>Indian Rummy</b>. They can be accessed by playing Rummy School on the <Link href="https://www.a23.com/">A23</Link> Rummy Fun app, the premier <b>online Rummy</b> platform. It is essential that users take a look at these before they <b>play Rummy online</b>. Here is a simple <b>Rummy tutorial:</b>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Rummy can be played by 2-6 players. <b>Indian Rummy</b> rules require 13 cards to be distributed to each player. Each deck contains two Jokers (one wild/cut and one printed/paper). There are also two stacks from which each player can choose cards and draw a card. Once a player draws a card, they have to get rid of one card - this is called discarding. One has to keep these in mind as they <b>play Rummy online</b>. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Sorting cards is done at the start of the Rummy online game to help you construct your sets and sequences while reducing the possibility of mixing the cards.  Once the cards are displayed, you can hit the Sort button and start playing <Link href="https://www.a23.com/rummy.html">online Rummy</Link>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As per the <b>Rummy tutorial</b>, when a player decides to leave the game table at the start or middle of a game as they <b>play Rummy online</b>, it is a drop. The act is to withdraw from the game as a personal choice. The first drop is 20 Rummy points; the middle drop is 40 points; and the last drop and maximum point loss are 80 points.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In <Link href="https://www.a23.com/rummy/pool-rummy.html">pool rummy</Link>, if a player drops into the 101 pool, the score is 20. In the case of 201 Pool Rummy, the drop score is 25. In a game where Best of 2/3 is played, a drop is not allowed - to <b>learn Rummy</b>, this information is crucial.
                            </p>

                                A wild joker can be any card at random from the closed deck and can replace any card to form an impure sequence. One needs to meld their cards into valid sequences and sets. A player must form at least 2 sequences (one pure), and arrange the rest of the cards in sequences and/or sets as they <b>play Rummy online</b>.

                                Even though this is not a winning formula, this Rummy Player's Guide will help you <b>learn Rummy online</b>. When it comes to learning to <b>play Rummy online</b>, players must know certain ins and outs of the game, which can help them gain an advantage over their opponents. Here are some easy tips for Rummy.
                            </p>
                            
                            <ul className="li-with-bullet my-list marker:text-[#eabf69]">
                                <li>
                                    Form the pure sequence at the very beginning of the <b>online Rummy</b> game.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Discard cards with high points like Ace, Jack, Queen, and King and replace these cards with Jokers or Wild Cards to reduce the pileup of points.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Avoid the discard pile. It gives away the hand you're trying to form.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Look out for smart cards. For example, a 7 from any suit can work with 5 and 6 of the same suit as well as 8 and 9 of the same suit.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Use jokers to replace high-value cards. Jokers and wild cards cannot be used to form pure sequences.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    An invalid declaration can turn even a winning online Rummy game into a complete loss. Make sure your declaration is valid before you meld.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    You must never give away jokers, especially if you already have a <Link href="https://www.a23.com/rummy/rummy-sequence.html">rummy pure sequence</Link>. It is because the <Link href="https://www.a23.com/rummy/joker-rummy.html">rummy Joker</Link> can help you finish another sequence. If there are already two sequences, you may use the joker to create sets or runs comprising high-value cards.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Keep an eye on the opponents: Keep track of the cards that other players choose and discard in different rummy card games. This will help you block some cards that can help them create melds.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Bluffing: Play to trick the opponents. Get rid of cards of lower value at first to create the impression that you have good cards and that the opponent might make a wrong move.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
