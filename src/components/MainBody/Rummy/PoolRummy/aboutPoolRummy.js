                    <div className="clear-both"></div>
                    <p><b>Pool Rummy</b> is a popular variation of the classic card game Rummy. The Rummy Pool Game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, with the aim of forming valid Rummy sets and sequences.</p>
                    <p><b>Online Rummy</b> is played in a relatively common format called "Syndicate" in which the player with the lowest score wins. The player is eliminated, and the game is won by the last player standing if the final score hits or is above 101/201. A game of Pool Rummy can have 2-6 participants.</p>

                    <p>In <b>Pool Rummy</b>, the game is played with a fixed number of deals, and the points scored in each deal are added to the player's score. The player with the lowest score at the end of all the deals is the winner.</p>
                    <p>When you play <b>Pool Rummy online</b>, you will come across two main types: 101 and 201.

                    <h2>Pool Rummy Rules</h2>
                    <div className="clear-both"></div>
                    <p>The cards are dealt to the players after being shuffled in a game of Pool Rummy online. The number of players in the game determines how many cards are dealt to each player. A two-player game deals each player 13 cards, whereas a three- or four-player game deals each player 7 cards.</p>
                    <p>The remaining cards are placed face down in the centre of the table to form the stockpile. The top card of the stock pile is turned face up to form the discard pile.</p>
                    <p>The player to the left of the dealer begins the game by drawing a card from either the stock pile or the discard pile. The player can choose to take the top card of the stockpile or any card from the top of the discard pile. Once the player has drawn a card, they must discard one of the cards from their hand. The discarded card is placed face-up on top of the discard pile.</p>
                    <p>The game continues in a clockwise direction, with each player drawing and discarding cards in turn. The aim of the game is to form valid sets and sequences. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but of different suits. For example, a set could be three kings of different suits. A sequence is a group of three or more cards of the same suit in numerical order. For example, a sequence could be the six, seven, and eight hearts.</p>
                    <p>A player can declare their hand as soon as they have formed all their cards into valid sets and sequences. The player must then lay their cards down on the table for the other players to see. If the cards are found to be valid, the player wins the game and scores zero points. If the cards are found to be invalid, the player's score is calculated based on the point value of the cards in their hand.</p>
                    <p>In <b>Pool Rummy</b>, the point value of each card is as follows:</p>
                    <ul className="listicon">
                        <li>Ace: 10 points</li>
                        <li>Face cards (King, Queen, and Jack): 10 points</li>
                        <li>Number cards: face value (e.g. a 5 of any suit is worth 5 points.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The player with the lowest score at the end of all the deals is the winner. In case of a tie, the player with the lowest score in the final deal is the winner.</p>
                    <p>The player with the lowest score at the end of all the deals is the winner. In case of a tie, the player with the lowest score in the final deal is the winner.</p>
